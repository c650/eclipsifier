# eclipsifier
A simple program to convert a folder of java files into an Eclipse project because Eclipse sucks but some teachers need you to use that format for their class(es).

### Usage:

Run the script without arguments and it'll tell you how to use it.

I have tested it on macOS and Ubuntu.

### License:

This code is under the [MIT LICENSE](/LICENSE). As such, I am __NOT LIABLE__ if you fail a class or assignment because my program doesn't work.
